# HR Attrition Analysis

## Objective
Analyze who, when, and why employee attrition occurs, forecast HR dynamics over
5–10 years, and propose talent optimization strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- LibreOffice: data cleaning
- SQL (SQLite): data extraction and aggregation
- R: statistical modeling and forecasting
- Jupyter Notebook (Python): orchestration and reporting

## Project Structure
- data_raw/      → original HR dataset
- data_clean/    → cleaned dataset used for analysis
- notebooks/     → final Jupyter notebook
- outputs/       → model results and forecasts
- docs/          → assumptions and cleaning rules

## Key Outputs
- Attrition analysis by role, department, and tenure
- Logistic regression model identifying attrition drivers
- 5–10 year scenario-based attrition forecast
- Actionable talent optimization recommendations

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/`
2. Run cells top-to-bottom
3. Review SQL outputs, model results, and conclusions

## Notes
- Raw data is preserved for transparency.
- All modeling assumptions are explicitly documented.
